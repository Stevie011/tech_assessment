I used a very straightforward Django setup as per the documentation/many tutorials available online

I created a model with the required fields, created a forms.py file and used the builtin ModelForm to generate the new form.

I then added the form and the most recent UserDetails object to the page context and the html.

Used import_export to handle files


TO DO:

add verification for uploaded file type
